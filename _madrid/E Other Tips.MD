* Beware of pickpockets! On the metro, going out, just walking around - they are good and can steal almost anything. 
* Get the Madrid transportation card! If you’re under 26, you can pay 8 euros a month (and a one time fee of 4 euros for the card) and get unlimited rides on the Metro, Cercanías, and buses! Absolute must!!
* Getting to the airport from the city is really easy using public transportation. There’s a metro line that takes you directly to the terminals, and it’s free if you have your transportation card, so you don’t have to pay for an uber.
* My favorite place to grocery shop is Mercadona!! They have such fresh food and the best options! My favorite things to get: tortilla de patata con cebolla (my favorite tortilla!), fuet, gazpacho, salmorejo, jamón serrano or ibérico, queso manchego, queso añejo ibérico, fresh loaf of French bread. 
* Bolt: very similar to Uber, but it’s cheaper. 
* Ask for agua de grifo (tap water) if you don’t want to pay for bottled water at restaurants. 
* Spaniards eat dinner at 10 pm. Most dinner places won’t open until 7 or 8 pm so make sure to check if you want to go earlier.
* Food is so fresh in Madrid which is awesome, but it will go bad fast! Too many times we found mold in our jam so be careful.
