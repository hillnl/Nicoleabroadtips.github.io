* Espit Chupitos: shots bar!! So so fun! 4 shots for 10 euros, and the bartenders are so entertaining! I recommend playing the games and asking them for their favorite ones. We did a russian roulette one, a harry potter one, one where they set your thumb on fire, and a lot of other ones! Best place to pregame before going to a club!
* Barcelo: really fun club! Usually free entry if you get a QR code, and they also have free wine and beer for early entry (12-1 am). Expect to see a lot of Americans and study abroad students. 
* El Chapandaz: cave bar! This was really cool and very different vibes from the typical nightclubs. There were no Americans and they were playing only Spanish music so it was a lot more local! There might be a line to get in, and the line gets longer the later it gets (I remember we left at 3 am and the line was pretty long lol). 
* Kapital: this is one of the oldest clubs in Madrid and it’s super popular! It has 7 floors and each floor has different music (one of them also has a karaoke room). Expect the line to be long to get in, and you get a discounted price if you go early (from 12-1 am). 
* Fucking Monday: another nightclub that is really popular, especially for study abroad students. It’s only open on Monday nights.
* Rubicon: another nightclub that was really fun! It’s actually really close to where I grew up :)
* Lolina: super cute drinks place! It has a retro theme and is great for casual drinks. 
* Motel: a casual bar in barrio salamanca. One of my brother’s best friends owns it, so if you go make sure to say you know the Hill family! 
* Dubliners: 1 euro shot bar on Wednesdays! 
* Cuenca club: it’s known for being a gay club, and has 3 floors with different music. It was really fun when I went, and they play more pop music than other clubs! 
* With all of these clubs, it’s nice if you can talk to promoters who give you QR codes so you get in free, at a lower price, or get a table.
