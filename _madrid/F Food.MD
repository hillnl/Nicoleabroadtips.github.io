* Tortilla española from Mercadona: tortilla española is kind of like a potato omelette which sounds like breakfast but Spaniards will eat this for lunch or dinner. This comes pre-made from Mercadona, and I’d buy it and have it almost every day for any meal. It’s so good and Mercadona has the best pre-made one! You can also get this when you go out to eat. 
* Fuet: kind of like sausage, but it’s so good!! It’s just a stick of meat and you cut it up and it’s ready to eat. This is so good to snack on or we had it when we had a Spanish tapas dinner. You can get this at any grocery store or order it at some restaurants. No Americans really know about it but it’s one of my faves! I usually get the Fuet Espetec brand at Mercadona.
* Croquetas: these are my favorite tapas! They’re fried balls of ham and cheese and you can get them at any tapas restaurant!
* Chistorra: this is a tapa that none of my friends knew about but loved! It’s a red sausage and you can get it at most tapas restaurants (my favorite chistorra is from La Chiquita or Casa del Abuelo)! 
* Jamón ibérico: this is what Spain is known for! I don’t know how to describe it other than really really good ham haha! My favorite lunch was a bocadillo de jamón ibérico y queso manchego from oink!
* Queso manchego: this is a classic Spanish cheese!
* Gazpacho or salmorejo: cold tomato soup is the best way to describe it. I loved getting one or both of these from mercadona, and then you can pour it in a bowl and dip fresh bread into it, and it’s so good! This is a very popular first dish of a Spanish meal. 
* Calamares: calamari aren’t specific to Spain, but they’re really good in Madrid or if you visit any coastal cities in Spain!
* Candy: I love Spanish candy, and my favorites are the ladrillos and tubos! You can get these anywhere, but again my favorites are from Mercadona.
