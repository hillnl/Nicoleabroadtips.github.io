* Villa Capri: amazing Italian place with a super cute ambiance! A little more expensive. The truffle pasta and the gnocchi were sooo good. 
* Tiki Taco: super cheap taco place that is so yummy! I love the cochinada (smoked pork) taco. 
* Takos al Pastor: another great cheap tacos place! The line can be long though so sometimes it’s worth it to go earlier. 
* Nagi Specialty Coffee: cute little coffee shop to do work. The owner is so friendly and nice! It was one of my friend’s favorite places to hang out.
* El Buey: traditional Spanish steakhouse. It has an older vibe but the food is so good, especially the chuleton (steak). My family and I always go to this one address: Calle del General Díaz Porlier, 9. 
* Asador: another really good steakhouse, but fancier. This has an all around great atmosphere. Real Madrid goes here when they win any big title, and every famous person hits this spot. If you mention Rob the American sent you, they’ll smile (that’s my dad lol). 
* Zenith: really good brunch place. There’s a few of them in the city, and the one in Malasaña is one of the top rated brunch places in the world!
* El.la: rooftop restaurant on Gran Via. They have a menu del dia and the food was good. You can eat on the floor below the roof, then go up to the rooftop for a great view of the city!
* Palazzo: ice cream store I grew up going to! Some of my friends didn’t like it as much because it’s not as milky as American ice cream.
* Ocafo: restaurant from Galicia with great seafood; my brother recommended this!
