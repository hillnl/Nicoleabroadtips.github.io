* Lateral: my favorite tapas place! These are all over the city and are a little nicer. My favorite things to order: croquetas (my favorite croquetas!), tosta de solomillo y brie, tosta de jamón con tomate, the artichoke hearts, tosta de queso de cabra con mermelada, the patatas bravas. 
* Casa Dani: right next to Mercado de La Paz; their tortilla de patata is incredible, and they won an award for it!
* Chocolateria San Ginés: iconic spot for churros con chocolate!
* Mercado San Miguel: this is a really famous market right next to plaza de sol. It’s a cool indoor market with a lot of food options and drinks. It’s super popular though and it’s always pretty busy
* Casa del Abuelo: this used to be my favorite tapas place when I lived in Madrid (I went back this year and it’s not as good though tbh, but I think it’s still worth it)! It’s also a little nicer. I always go to the one on Goya because it’s closest to where I used to live but there are a lot of locations over the city. My favorite things to order: chistorra, asparagus, croquetas, tabla de jamón ibérico, gambas al ajillo. 
* La Barraca: great paella but on the more expensive side. We got the campera/ countryside paella and it was really good, the flan for dessert was also great! 
* La Chiquita: casual restaurant right next to Plaza Mayor. My favorite things to order: chistorra (sooo good here!), paella. 
* Museo de Jamón: literally translates to “Museum of Ham,” but it’s a great place to grab a quick bocadillo (sandwich) or pastry! They have legs of ham covering the walls, and there are a bunch of locations throughout the city. I love to get a bocadillo and then go hang out at Retiro. My favorite is the bocadillo mixto de jamón ibérico y queso manchego. 
* Oink: very similar to museo de jamón; they have these all over the city and you can get a really good sandwich there. My favorite is the bocadillo de jamón y queso. It’s so cheap and the perfect lunch! 
* La Abacería: good, more casual tapas place. Portions are big so we ordered too much. My favorite things to order: tabla de jamón ibérico de bellota y pan con tomate; tosta de foie con miel de trufa blanca. 
* 100 Montaditos: super cheap tapas place and very casual; they have a menu of like 100 different bocadillos (small sandwiches). You can also get a super cheap jarra de sangria! My favorite bocadillos to order (I would recommend getting 2-3 for lunch): Jamón Gran Reserva, tomate y aceite de oliva virgen extra; jamón gran reserva y queso madurado; tortilla de patata y salsa aioli.
