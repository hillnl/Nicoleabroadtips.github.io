* Retiro Park: my favorite park ever!! It’s a huge park in the middle of the city, and I used to live 5 minutes from it. Fun to walk around, run, read, have a picnic, or just hang out! Also, I highly recommend doing the rowboats in the park at least once. It’s 6 euros and such a fun activity! The palacio de crystal inside the park is also really pretty. 
* Hotel Riu Plaza España 360 degree bar: amazing rooftop restaurant with 360 views of the city! Loved this for watching the sunset and getting drinks. Entry costs 10 euros after 6 pm and 5 euros before 6 pm, but it is so worth it! 
* Temple de Debod: fun place to watch the sunset! It was an old Egyptian temple and there’s a lookout right next to it with a view of the whole city. Super popular sunset place, so it’s usually pretty busy but still cool!
* El Rastro: huge flea market on Sundays. They have a ton of leather jackets, and that’s where I got mine, but they also have almost anything you could think of! It’s super big, so plan on spending a few hours there. Bring cash because most booths won’t take credit cards. Eliza loved to barter but it really helped that we could speak fluent Spanish! 
* Flamenco show: Spain is known for its flamenco, and I recommend going to at least one show during your trip! I used to take flamenco lessons when I lived here :)
* Prado Museum: the most famous museum in Madrid. Has a lot of famous classical pieces, like Las Meninas by Goya. 
* Reina Sofia Museum: modern and contemporary art museum. You can see Picasso’s Guernica here!
* Sorolla Museum: museum dedicated to the life and art of Joaquin Sorolla that’s located in his house. 
* Royal Palace: you can get tickets to walk around inside it, and it’s really pretty!
* Wine tasting: 
* Gran Via: main street with a lot of shops and the classic clothing stores like Zara, Primark, Mango, H&M, and more! If you want some cute boutique clothing stores, walk along Fuencarral, which is right next to it. My apartment during my semester abroad was 2 min from Gran Via and on Fuencarral! Ideal location, so fun, and so busy all the time!
* Plaza Mayor: it used to be the city center and where they executed people in old times lol. So it’s very historic! Now it’s always busy and just cool to walk around. 
* Puerta de Sol: current city center. You can see El Oso y El Madroño, which is a bear statue, that is the coat of arms for Madrid. You’ll also see that symbol on trash cans and grates throughout the city! 
* Barrio Salamanca: nice neighborhood with good, more expensive shopping! This is where I grew up!
* Riding bikes at Casa de Campo: this is a big nature area on the outskirts of the city. My friend said you can rent bikes there and it’s really pretty to just ride around! 
* Hike in Navacerrada: we did a hike in Navacerrada that was super pretty!
