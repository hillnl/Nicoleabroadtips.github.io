## Overall
Overall rating: 9/10. Malta is such a beautiful country with so much history! It was fun to learn about Malta’s role in World War II and walk around Valletta and St. Julien’s, but my favorite part was for sure the boat tour! The water was so blue and definitely the prettiest I’ve ever seen, and all the caves and groves were spectacular. The water was pretty cold because it was April, but it was so much fun to explore, swim, and just enjoy! It was an amazing trip, and I would totally go back! 

## Activities
* Boat tour: we did a private half day boat tour that was incredible! Originally we had booked a big group tour, but it was so windy it ended up being cancelled. The private tour with 4 of my friends ended up being incredible though!! We sailed around some groves and caves and rock formations, then went by Gozo and got to see it from the coast. We stopped at a few swimming spots where we could snorkel and at a few cliff jumping spots where we could jump. Then we sailed to a little beach area and got to lay in the sand. Our last stop was the Blue Lagoon, which was a naturally secluded area with crystal blue water that was spectacular! It was such an amazing day with insanely pretty views! And our boat guide let us hang out for 2 more hours on the boat so we really got our money’s worth!

* Valletta: the historic part of Malta and its capital. Really fun to walk around, explore the city, and shop!

* Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens: pretty garden with beautiful views of the city. You can watch them fire cannons here too, which was cool!

* St. Julien’s: this is the town we stayed in. It is seaside and has a bunch of bars and restaurants. The main strip is good for going out!
* Balluta Bay: a nice, small, sandy beach in a small cove in St. Julians Bay, and it’s right next to a lot of restaurants! Not the kind of American beach though, it’s super small but just cute to walk by.

* Independence Garden: great place to watch the sunset and a 10 min walk from the center of St. Julien’s.

## Transportation
* We mostly used uber because it was pretty cheap or just walked around.

## Other
They use a UK plug, not an EU one, so bring a converter!
