## Overall
Overall rating: 10/10. I LOVE Interlaken so much!! Such a cute town surrounded by beautiful mountains and two stunning lakes on either side. After the city trips we were doing, this was such a breath of fresh air. This was one of my two favorite trips of all of study abroad, and I really want to go back!!

## Activities
* Kayaking on Lake Brienz: best best best part of the trip was the kayaking!! It was kinda expensive but so worth it!! Plus it’s 3 hours long so you really get your money’s worth. Literally a top 10 experience of my life!! The lake is beautiful and the kayaking is so fun! And it was just 5 of us and our guide who was awesome. We went in the winter too and they just put you in dry suits that keep you warm! Highly highly recommend this!! There are also so many other activities you can do in Interlaken, like paragliding, skydiving, snowshoeing, but I will say kayaking felt like the best bang for your buck. It’s the cheapest but the longest activity. 
  * This is the website where we booked it: [High Tide](https://hightide.ch/en/experience/winter-kayak-activity-interlaken/). 
* Sunset at Lake Thun: after kayaking, we took a bus to the other lake in Interlaken, Lake Thun, and watched the sun set!
* Lauterbrunnen Valley Hike: We took a 25 min bus from Interlaken that was so pretty and then did a walk along a paved path. You’re surrounded by mountains and these super tall cliffs with waterfalls! Once you get to the end after about an hour and a half of walking, you can take a bus back to Lauterbrunnen, and then another bus back to Interlaken. Definitely recommend for a half-day activity. You can also do a day trip to Grindelwald from Interlaken, which I’ve heard is also great!

## Hostel
** Balmer’s Hostel: oldest and most famous hostel in Interlaken, and it was awesome! There were a ton of study abroad students there, which was really fun. The rooms were nice, the location was perfect, and there was a hot tub. There’s also a club in the basement of it, which was almost empty the two nights we went but still very fun honestly!

## Transportation
* We took buses to get to most places, and we took a train to get from Zurich to Interlaken. Buy your bus and train tickets because they will check, and one of my friends got a $150 fine for not having a ticket. 

## Other
* We were trying to save money on this trip because Switzerland is so expensive, so we just went to Coop (the grocery store) for meals which worked out really well! I recommend saving money on food because apparently Swiss food isn’t that good (other than chocolate and fondue).
