## Overall
Overall rating: 10/10. I LOVE Sorrento!! This was one of my favorite trips of all of study abroad! The locals were so friendly and chatty, the town was so cute and walkable, there was so much to do, and all of the incredible activities we did were just a bus ride away! We were debating staying here or in Positano, and I’m so glad we stayed here because Positano would’ve been a lot more expensive, and Sorrento was awesome! 

## Activities
* Bagno Regina Giovanna: super pretty little cove about an hour walk from Sorrento! Apparently a queen used to bathe here and that's who it's named after. It also had some remains of a Roman village. The water was really cold, but the views were so pretty, and it was so fun to swim around.
* Path of the Gods/Il Sentiero Degli Dei: insanely beautiful hike where cliffs meet the ocean. This is the path that ancient Romans took to get from Bomerano to Nocelle (the towns we started and ended in). It was definitely one the prettiest hikes I’ve ever done, but it wasn’t easy. It took us about 3 hours to do the hike itself, and then you have to walk down 1700 steps and walk a while further to get from Nocelle to Positano. As a whole, it took us 4-5 hours but the views were amazing, and we had an incredible time! Be warned though, we talked to some locals and apparently they don’t do it because a few people die each year doing it. Just be careful and you’ll be fine, but you are fully just walking along the side of a cliff.

* Capri boat tour: this boat tour was so fun!! The boat driver took us inside these cool caves, and we got to see the famous arches next to Capri. Then we docked and got to explore Capri for 4 hours! The first two hours we spent on this one area of the island where we took a lift up the mountain and got to see beautiful views of the town, which I would definitely recommend doing. Then, we spent another hour on the main part of Capri, and we ended up exploring and randomly finding this amazing viewpoint that was super far up and completely secluded. Then we headed back to Sorrento on the boat and stopped at a spot to swim in the beautiful water!
  * This is the [boat tour](https://www.viator.com/tours/Sorrento/Capri-Boat-Tour-for-Small-Groups-from-Sorrento/d947-136733P1) that we booked, and we really liked it! It was a group boat tour though, so there were 10 people on our boat, and I feel like you could get unlucky/lucky depending on who the other people are. 
* Day trip to Pompeii: I’m so glad we went and got to see Pompeii. It was so much bigger than I imagined, so I feel like we only got to see a small portion of it. We ended up buying the audio guide, and I think that was really worth it to learn the history. It was just a quick train ride away from Sorrento, so it worked out really well as a day trip!

## Restaurants
* Frankie’s Pizza Bar: incredible pizza and pasta, and the best meatballs ever! Frankie was our airbnb host, and he’s the BEST! He gave us free shots of limoncello because we stayed with him, and he was so fun to talk to. We literally ate here 2 out of our 3 nights because it was so good!

## Transportation
* We were able to walk everywhere in Sorrento, and then or took buses or trains to get to most of the activities or day trips.

## Other
* Villa Comunale di Sorrento: cute little park in the middle of Sorrento. Great place to watch the sunset.
