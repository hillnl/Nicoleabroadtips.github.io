## Overall
Overall rating: 6/10. There honestly wasn’t a ton to do in Zurich so I’m glad we were only there for a little bit. The Lindt Chocolate Factory was 100% my favorite part but I love chocolate!

## Activities
* Lindt Chocolate Factory: my favorite part of Zurich!! We did the audio tour and you get so many free samples. We brought a tote bag and sneakily took a lot of the truffles home at the end, so I would recommend doing that too! 
* Grossmunster and Fraumunster towers: two towers separated by a bridge and river. We went to the top of Grossmunster and then walked along the docks and bridge in between the two towers. 

## Hostel
* Zurich Youth Hostel: we were only there for one night and it worked perfectly! It was pretty cheap and had free breakfast in the morning which was really nice because Switzerland is more expensive.

## Transportation
* We took buses to get to most places, and we took a train to get from Zurich to Interlaken. Buy your bus and train tickets because they will check, and one of my friends got a $150 fine for not having a ticket. 

## Other
* We were trying to save money on this trip because Switzerland is so expensive, so we just went to Coop (the grocery store) for meals which worked out really well! I recommend saving money on food because apparently Swiss food isn’t that good (other than chocolate and fondue).
